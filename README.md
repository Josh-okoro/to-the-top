THE STORY BEHIND THE GAME

In real life, we humans embark on a never-ending journey of seeking knowledge. 
We want to acquire information that would prepare us for our next challenge.

In the game, we assume the role of a player who does the same. 
They have to climb to the top of their game, avoiding obstacles along the way.

When they get to their destination(the top of the game - end of the level), 
they finally acquire relevant information from a book that makes them wiser 
and more equipped for their next challenge(next level).
